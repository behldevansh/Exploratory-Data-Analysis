# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on various features such as class, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, and embarked location.

## Project Overview

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizations of survival rates based on class and gender.
   - Distribution analysis of passenger ages.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values for numeric and categorical features.
   - Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.
   - Scaling and transforming features as needed.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Using a RandomForestClassifier to train the model.
   - Evaluating model performance with accuracy score and classification report.

4. **Inference:**
   - Making predictions on sample data to infer survival chances of passengers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- seaborn
- pandas
- matplotlib
